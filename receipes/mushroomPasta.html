    <ul>

        <li>Pasta</li>

        <li>garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta as instructed, drain and set aside. I always like to undercook by one minute to ensure it is al dente.</li>
        <li>In a bowl whisk together dairy free milk and plain flour. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a skillet over medium to high heat melt the dairy free butter, saut√© mushrooms until they have started to wilt and then stir through crushed garlic. 
            Give the milk and flour a quick stir to pick up the flour from the bottom of the bowl and then pour over the mushrooms, add half of the chopped parsley, 
            paprika, salt, pepper and lemon juice. Lower heat to low - medium, and stir through until the sauce has thickened. Add cooked pasta and stir everything 
            together. Serve and garnish with remaining parsley.</li>
    </ol>
